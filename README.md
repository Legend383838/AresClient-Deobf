# AresClient-Deobf

This is the pvp client, which is closed source, not the open source anarchy one.


Ares client devs are so special mentally they thought Superblaubree obfuscation was the real deal. 

Hopefully after I publish this repo they will switch to a better obfuscator after they finish shitting their pants.

This client is nearly 100% pasted, code is the definition of shit.
